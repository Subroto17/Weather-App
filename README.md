# Weather App
This is a simple Weather App built using JavaScript. It allows users to check the current weather conditions either based on their location or by searching for a specific city.

## Features
1. Location-based Weather: Users can grant access to their location, and the app will fetch and display the current weather conditions for their location.
2. Search Weather: Users can also search for weather conditions in any city by entering the city name into the search bar.
3. Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive and works well on various screen sizes.

## Usage
To use the app, simply click on the "Your Weather" tab to see the weather based on your location. If you prefer to search for weather in a different city, 
click on the "Search Weather" tab and enter the city name into the search bar.

## How it Works

The app uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch weather data based on the user's location or the searched city. 
It dynamically updates the UI with the retrieved weather information.
